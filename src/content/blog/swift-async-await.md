Swift's async/await syntax has revolutionized how we write asynchronous code. Gone are the days of completion handler pyramids and callback hell.

## The Old Way

```swift
func fetchData(completion: @escaping (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void) {
    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
        if let error = error {
            completion(.failure(error))
            return
        }
        guard let data = data else {
            completion(.failure(NetworkError.noData))
            return
        }
        completion(.success(data))
    }.resume()
}
```

## The New Way

```swift
func fetchData() async throws -> Data {
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    return data
}
```

Much cleaner and easier to read!

## Benefits

- **Linear code flow**: Code reads top to bottom
- **Better error handling**: Standard try/catch patterns
- **Easier to test**: No completion handlers to mock
- **Improved performance**: Structured concurrency is more efficient

This is just the beginning of what modern Swift concurrency can do. Stay tuned for more deep dives!
