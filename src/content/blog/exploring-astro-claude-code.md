Was a bit procrastinating this task from my todo list, but now I'm finally working on it. I've backed my website with combination of Astro and Claude Code assistance. Works good so far. At least I was able to add "Experience" section as well as added static blog. Will do my best to reduce a friction to write posts here by writing all posts in MD format that Claude Code will eventually convert to proper static pages.
