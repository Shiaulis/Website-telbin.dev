		<h1>Hello from Andrius 👋🏾</h1>
		<p>I'm a passionate iOS developer with 8+ years of experience. Great apps aren't just functional — they should feel natural, be accessible to everyone, and meet both simple and complex user needs.</p>

		<p>By day, I work as a Senior iOS Developer at Pipedrive. In my spare time, I dive into everything from backend/frontend web development to productivity tools, touch typing, and even content creation.</p>

		<p>Feel free to look around — happy to connect!</p>
